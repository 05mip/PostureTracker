<h1>Posture Checker Using MediaPipe</h1>
<p>This program uses a web cam pointed at the right side of your body to ensure that your posture is correct. 
  It uses google's MediaPipe to track body points and tracks the angle between your nose, shoulder and hip.
  You can calibrate the program by pressing 'c' and then sitting in a correctly postured position; this will be used as the baseline
  After calibration, if the angle of those three body points decreases more than 10 degrees past the baseline, the program will sound a beep.</p>
